        Syntax

arr.reduce(callback[, initialValue])

Parameters

callback
    Function to execute on each element in the array, taking four arguments:

    accumulator
        The accumulator accumulates the callback's return values; it is the accumulated value previously returned in the last invocation of the callback, or initialValue, if supplied (see below).
    currentValue
        The current element being processed in the array.
    currentIndexOptional
        The index of the current element being processed in the array. Starts at index 0, if an initialValue is provided, and at index 1 otherwise.
    arrayOptional
        The array reduce() was called upon.

initialValueOptional
    Value to use as the first argument to the first call of the callback. If no initial value is supplied, the first element in the array will be used. Calling reduce() on an empty array without an initial value is an error.

Return value

The value that results from the reduction.
